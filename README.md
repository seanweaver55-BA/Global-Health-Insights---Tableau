# Global Health Insights Dashboard

This Tableau project explores key health and demographic trends across countries and continents using interactive visual analytics. The dashboard highlights how factors such as life expectancy, BMI, and population growth vary across regions, offering valuable insights for global health monitoring and decision-making.  

## Tools and Data
- **Tool**: Tableau Public  
- **Dataset**: Gapminder Global Health Data (population, life expectancy, BMI, gender distribution, etc.)  

---

## Project Objective
To analyze global health indicators and demographic patterns in order to identify trends, disparities, and correlations that can guide future health initiatives and research efforts.

## Dashboard Design
**Dashboard Name**: Global Health Dashboard  

The dashboard integrates multiple views into a single interface for at-a-glance insights:  
- Life Expectancy by Continent  
- Population Distribution by Gender  
- Life Expectancy vs BMI  
- Population Growth by Country  
- Life Expectancy Trends  

**Interactivity:**  
- Filters by country and continent  
- Consistent filters applied across worksheets  

---

## Key Insights
- Life expectancy varies sharply between continents, with Europe showing higher averages compared to Africa.  
- Gender population breakdowns provide demographic context for country-level comparisons.  
- BMI and life expectancy display visible correlations in certain regions.  
- African countries such as Nigeria, Chad, and Niger account for a significant share of global population growth between 2000–2020.

## Future Enhancements
- Add forecasting models for population and health outcomes.  
- Include socio-economic factors to strengthen the analysis.  
- Optimize the dashboard layout for mobile and smaller screens.
